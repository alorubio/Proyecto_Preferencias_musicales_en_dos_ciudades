# Analysis of Music Preferences in Two Cities

## Introduction
The objective of the project is to analyze data to extract valuable information and make decisions based on it. This involves different stages, such as data overview, preprocessing, and hypothesis testing.

In this project, the music preferences of the cities of Springfield and Shelbyville are compared. Real-world online music streaming data will be studied to test the hypothesis below and compare user behavior in these two cities.

## Objective:
Hypothesis Testing:

User activity differs by day of the week and by city.

## Stages
The data will be examined before testing the hypothesis.
Data quality will be assessed, and the extent of the issues will be analyzed. Then, during data preprocessing, the most critical issues will be addressed.

#### The project will consist of three stages:
1. Data Description
2. Data preprocessing.
3. Hypothesis testing.
